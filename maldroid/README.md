malDroid
========

A web application for analysing potentially malicious Android applications.

### TODO:
 * Design application reports, these should be inserted
   into the DB, and query-able via a hash of the APK

 * Design the view for reports :P

 * Create a list of APK scanners/analysis engines/things we can use
   to scan and generate our reports.
   - Virus Total
   - Andrubis
   - ...

 * Hosting? Digital Ocean is cheap, we also need a domain name, and
   may have to rename the project, as maldroid is a rock band :(

 * Refine upload engine, so that only APKs are uploadable.  Right now
   a few files are uploadable for testing purposes :P
